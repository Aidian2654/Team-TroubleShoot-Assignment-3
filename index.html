                As a group we decided on the name “Team Troubleshoot”. We thought
                it was a memorable name and the term troubleshoot is one that is relatable to IT.

              My name’s Bryce Allen, and I am currently undertaking RMIT’s Bachelor
              of I.T. I am a proud member of Team Troubleshoot for the purpose of
              this assignment. I have moved back and forth between Ballarat and
              Melbourne the last few years and have finally settled down back in
              Ballarat where I was born. I currently work for a small company
              building high-end custom PCs for both personal and commercial use.
              My role is assembling, testing, and troubleshooting our products.
              I have always had a passion for the hardware side of computing and
              hoping to expand my knowledge into the software side of things.
              When I am not working or tinkering, I play in a few bands locally
              and have a passion for audio engineering and sound production; I
              am most often found in my sketchy home studio amongst a tangle of
              cables and gear.

                My name is Geoffrey Boyle and I am currently studying the Bachelor
                of Information Technology at RMIT University, I am a member of Team
                Troubleshoot for our assessment tasks. I am currently 43 years of age
                and was born in Brisbane, Australia. My current employer is Australia
                Post, for the past 13 years as a Postal Delivery Officer. My interests
                and hobbies consist of travelling, playing rugby league, watching
                movies, fishing, and working with computers. My interest in IT started
                back at high school, there are many different areas that I enjoy.
                For that reason, the current field that I would like to pursue is
                still currently undecided. Ideally to become multi-skilled with
                Networking, Web Development, and some Programming would be my dream.
                With the variety of subjects on offer from RMIT University, it will
                expand my knowledge and through study, I will find the career
                pathway that I will pursue in the future. My current experience in
                IT relates to building computers, upgrading, diagnosing problems
                and repairs. After completing high school in 1995, I had continued
                further study in Web Development, however I need to retrain my skills
                in this field.

                My name is Mitchell and I am a member of Team Troubleshoot. I am
                studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University
                and have a strong passion for technology and software development.
                I grew up in Queensland, Australia and began my degree there while
                I was working as a Business Analyst at a technology company in
                Brisbane City. Since then I have moved to Scotland, UK and studying
                remotely from there while also working as a software engineer. I
                have been working as a software developer for 1-2 years now and
                am focused on frontend development using Vue.js, but also work on
                some backend systems in PHP. Currently some of my favourite tech
                I am playing with is Vue.js (with a close eye on the upcoming v3
                release), DevOps CI/CD, serverless development and containerization
                (Docker and Kubernetes). If I am not playing around with tech I
                play (well played thanks to the pandemic) a lot of social sport,
                including AFL, touch football and indoor soccer.

                My name is Emre Sezgin. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria and now
                I reside in Brisbane, Queensland. I am a member of team troubleshoot.
                I am undertaking a bachelor of IT and my most up to date education
                is high school. Even though I grew up in Melbourne my nationality is
                Turkish/Australian, which means I also know Turkish as well and a
                little bit of Arabic. I work in aviation as ground operations officer
                at Brisbane airport (BNE). An interesting fact about me is that
                even though I love Holdens very much and own one myself, I was awfully
                close to buying a Ford and ruining my loyalty to Holden, sadly I am
                also devastated that the great lion will not be with us any longer.

                Some hobbies of mine are tennis, video games but mostly working on my car. Fixing
                it myself and learning new stuff while at it. The most recent modification I have
                done to it was installing a remote start module which allows it to start with the
                key, while pressing the lock button 3 times without the key even being inside the car.

                My name is Aidian and I am a member of Team Troubleshoot. I was
                born in Brisbane Queensland and moved down to Burnie Tasmania at
                an early age, after year 12 I moved down to Launceston to further
                my career and study but ended up getting a trainee IT position at
                the Department of Education. I am hoping to acquire a permanent
                position before my Trainee role ends. I Completed Year 12 and 2
                Units at Utas University for my Batchelor’s of Information Communications
                and Technology’s. I am currently studying through Open University
                with RMIT to complete the rest of my Batchelor’s. I have always had
                interest in IT technology’s which got me wanting to be a part of
                the IT industry. My main area of interest is networking as the idea
                of making systems communicate over large distances fascinates me.
                I have had 5 months experience within an IT role and may years of
                little troubleshooting jobs throughout the family. My hobbies
                include Gaming, VR, building computers and watching online videos.

              Team Troubleshoot worked well together as a group by setting our
              targets and achieving our goals before every meeting. The meetings
              were conducted twice per week at a time that was suitable and agreed
              upon for all members to attend. There were a few minor things that
              we could have improved within the group, some of these improvements
              relate to planning and organization. We will be taking what we have
              learnt from assignment 2 and improving our processes for assignment
              3. We have already started our improvements by starting early,
              setting a plan from the beginning, and ensuring we are spreading
              the work.

                our group as all 6 of us have unique pathways we can take to achieve
                our goals. Mitchell to become a software engineer will have to study
                and specialize in programming. Where Aidian who wants to become a
                Network engineer will need to study and specialize in Networking
                achieving standards and certificates to ensure he is qualified.
                Bryce will need to study Cyber Security to ensure he has the skills
                to become a Security Analyst. The pathway taken depends on the
                specialization chosen.

                Each of our positions all have the similarity of the team environment,
                we will all be working within a team to meet some goal. We will all need excellent communication skills to be able to do our role
                effectively and we will all need to constantly update ourselves
                with knowledge of new technology's, updates, and changes to ensure
                we can work efficiently.
                Although we will have this similarity our day-to-day work will
                be different. Mitchells position as a Software Engineer means he
                will be spending most of his days programming, testing, and planning
                the creation/ updating and maintaining of software. This position
                allows for him to have the opportunity to work from offsite
                location as he is not tied to completing onsite tasks. When
                Mitchells position is compared to Emre’s we can see where these
                differences come from. Emre’s position is an IT Technical Officer,
                this position entails giving support to his clients, maintaining
                and upgrading current systems and providing technical support if
                something goes wrong. This position is mainly onsite whether it is
                in the office preparing for calls or to their location to assess
                any issues. These differences can be shown for all our positions
                as our specialized areas all have different requirements, needs
                and skills.

              Our creation of the GitHub site has gone through some significant
              changes after the feedback from assignment 2. We have followed the

              information into separate tabs dropdown sections and sliders between
              pages. We have also made sure to include more pictures and links to
              ensure the audience isn’t looking at a wall of text.

                Team Troubleshoot’s project idea is an inventory app we are calling
                Troubleshooter. Troubleshooter allows home users to take and store
                inventory of their home assets. The Troubleshooter app will assist
                in tasks such as insurance claims, warranty claim and tax claims.
                Troubleshooter will allow for the home user to store information
                needed about their assets like cost, Description of item, model,
                Serial Numbers, Date of purchase, Scan or upload photos or receipts.
                Troubleshooter will also be able to assist in the recording process
                with features like image scanning technologies to gather information
                from the receipts, Online databases that can search for additional
                information about your product, example images from the internet of
                your product, and all your data can be easily exportable into
                different formats straight from the app. All your data will be
                stored in a secure cloud-based server behind a secure two factor
                authentication.

                Troubleshooter is designed all around the user experience. As
                Troubleshooter is aimed at the home audience our app will have a
                sleek and uncomplicated design to it. You will easily be able to
                login, create an asset, edit assets, or remove assets when needed.
                With a simple searchable list with images of your item displayed
                it will make finding what you need easy. The asset creation will
                be easy on the user with features like scanning from the receipt
                and searching for addition information and images from the internet
                you will not even need to type in any information. Our goal is to
                have an easy to use, effortless app that any home user can use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The motivation for this project is around Internet of thing, Smart
                automation to make people's lives easier. The task of asset management
                is not something people want to be doing, this mindset leads people
                into situations where they need to submit a tax claim or insurance
                claim but do not have any of the information needed. This projects
                aim is to create an app that is easy to use, automates as much of
                the process as possible and keeps all the data safe. To incorporate
                these features, we will need to grasp knowledge in Optical character
                recognition (OCR), Image recognition, cloud databases and two factor
                authentications. These subjects are complex and require a lot of
                self-learning and training to pull off showing dedication and passion
                towards the outcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are currently plenty of asset management software's out there
                including nest egg, MyStuff and Sortly, apps like these are our
                main competitors, these apps are packed full of features advanced
                options and functions that the average user would be confused about
                making starting out more confusing than it needs to be. The Troubleshooter
                app will combat this with an easy to use, uncomplicated design based for
                the home user, we will implement functions such as scanning from a receipt,
                gathering information and images from the web all to make the user
                experience more enjoyable.

                Team Troubleshoot’s aim is to create a User-friendly app to record
                and keep track of assets. This app will be aimed at the home user to
                keep track of assets for insurance and tax claim purposes. Our app
                needs to have a clean modern design, functionality that is easy to
                follow for all users, Safe and secure data storage, Photo Scanning
                technology and a promotional video to show off all the features.
              </p>
              <p>
                The justification for this application is that there is only a small
                range of home inventory applications that give the freedom to store
                what you want and need. Our app will allow the user to add their own
                fields, Scan in photos, receipts, products from the internet. Our app
                will make sure the most information is recorded and available for
                the user as soon as they need it. All this information will improve
                tax returns and keep insurance claims delay free.
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve this larger goal, we will need to complete smaller tasks
                within the application, first goal would be to complete research of
                android app development and the possibility of using MIT Inventor
                to create the prototype. Research is essential when starting something
                new so looking at the skills we have and the tools we can use will
                be vital to starting this project. As we all have different coding
                knowledge, we think that using MIT Inventor to create the prototype
                would be a beneficial call as block-based coding is easier and faster
                to research and learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important goal is to create the back end or functionality
                of the application. This backend will handle all the user interactions,
                Passing Data, displaying the visuals correctly and allowing for the
                user to access and interact with the application. By completing the
                functionality of the application early on it allows for further
                testing, risk assessment and designing to take place all impacting
                the quality, efficiency, and usability of the application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data storage and security is a great concern for our team, one of
                our essential goals are to ensure all data is stored appropriately
                and secure. Storing data securely is extremely important to protect
                our data we record for the user. This data has sensitive financial
                information which should not be seen by unauthorized personnel, with
                storing this data in the cloud it brings both opportunity for
                security as well as risk that we will need to discover.
              </p>
              <p>
                Team Troubleshoots app needs to have a clean, modern, and function
                design not only functionally but visually. We need to create high
                quality visual elements and style for our app. This design will
                ensure the app is professional, easy to understand, visually appealing
                and easy to use.
              </p>

                The scanning feature is a unique feature that will separate our
                app from the competitors, this feature will allow you to scan in
                receipts to import information and allow the user to take a picture
                of the product and the app will find as much more relevant information
                using the name, image recognition and any other information given.
                This allows you to add more information about your asset without
                having to do research or investigating. This feature gives the
                user more of a premium experience making the asset recording process
                easier.
              </p>

                Creating a promotional video will help to bring awareness of the
                project. This promotional video is aimed to get home users to
                download the app and try the service we are providing. This
                promotional video needs to be professional, short sharp and
                straight to the point to keep the audience's attention. We will
                include subjects like the description of the app, security, and
                statistics.

                The concept for our team’s “Troubleshoot” Android application came
                into fruition throughout our work on Assignment 2. Based on team
                member Aidian’s initial assignment idea for an asset registry app,
                our team unanimously saw the potential value and usefulness of a
                successful implementation of Aidian’s idea – our project idea had
                been found, and immediately we set about brainstorming ideas as
                to what exact shape our end product would ideally take, as well
                as what features and utilities we would attempt to incorporate.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The idea was simple: the app would serve to take inventory and
                  record data for household items, storing all relevant data
                  (description, cost, models, date, serial numbers, photographs,
                  receipts etc.) in an easily accessible, cloud-based solution.
                  Within the app, the user would be able to upload a receipt,
                  then have the app scan and import the relevant data from the
                  receipt using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the
                  device’s onboard cameras. With all the relevant product information
                  conveniently condensed into a single application, the concept
                  will assist users in making insurance and warranty claims, as
                  well as provide a platform to easily organize and manage their
                  assets. Some initial focal points decided upon in our initial
                  Assignment 3 meetings included a “user-friendly interface” that
                  clearly and easily displays asset information such as photos,
                  serial numbers and descriptions, as well as the ability for users
                  to be able to create their own custom fields in order to better
                  organize their assets according to their individual needs.

              </p>
              <p>
                With some of the basic functionality of our app now fleshed out,
                we set about deciding how we would proceed with the actual development
                of our idea: what platform would we initially build on, and what tools
                would we utilize in order to create our app? With limited experience
                in app development between us, we required a solution that would be
                simple enough to use for amateur developers such as ourselves
                without being too limited to actually achieve at least some of
                the features we had planned. A great solution to this problem was
                presented by Aidian in our second group meeting in the form of
                the MIT App Inventor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The MIT App Inventor is a “blocks-based” programming environment
                that serves to simplify the programming aspect of app development,
                allowing the developer to issue instructions by dragging and
                dropping visual blocks, connecting them together to form logical
                paths. As newcomers to app development, this platform was perfect
                for us, allowing us to jump straight into assembling the various
                elements of our project immediately. Given that a major constraint
                of our project has been time, the fact that this platform has
                allowed us to immediately get to work without having to invest
                substantial amounts of time learning Java and Android Studio
                basics is perfect.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the simplicity of our elected platform is somewhat of a
                double-edged sword; while it has given us the ability to proceed
                with our project to some degree without any fundamental knowledge
                of app development, it is not a complete substitute for a proper
                text-based programming approach. Although this platform has enabled
                us to achieve our more basic designs for our application, we have
                still found it difficult to implement some of the more advanced
                techniques such as OCR. In order to include this functionality, a
                more in-depth understanding of Java and app development will be
                required. That said, the App Inventor has been the perfect tool
                for our needs and has allowed us to produce an adequate artefact
                that demonstrates the direction of our concept within the given
                time period.
              </p>

                <img src="assets/img/login.png" align="left" style="width:200px;height:350px;padding-right:30px;"/>                                                                                                
                Using the App Inventor, our team set about implementing many of
                the features we had decided upon during the design process. As
                security is of extreme importance in any app, but especially in
                an asset registry app such as ours, a login screen requiring
                username and password authentication has been incorporated.
                Through Google’s Firebase toolset, application data is now
                cloud-based, allowing for off-device storage of asset information,
                user data and stored images. Functionality has been incorporated
                to allow the editing of assets, as well as exporting to Excel
                documents. These implementations have been constantly worked on
                and refined over the course of weeks, with team members tweaking
                elements and debugging to enhance usability and functionality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our first implementation of the login screen was a simple take
                the username and password, store it into the database as plain
                text and compare it on login. This approach was an extremely
                unsecure login method that we used for testing purposes only while
                we where implementing the asset listing and adding asset
                functionality. For the beginning we made sure we could add assets
                store them onto the device and display them correct. We took this
                approach so that when we where testing the cloud storage, we would
                have visual indications of if it was working or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the implementation of the simple functions of adding, deleting
                and viewing assets we set to work on the cloud-based solutions we
                wanted to implement. First, we started with the login as we didn’t
                want to just store the logins in plain text, we set the Realtime
                database as not suitable to use, instead we opted for using firebases
                authentication. This allows us to create accounts, have them email
                verified, have a password reset option and ensure we have encrypted
                and secure logins. Implementing these features was a challenge as
                MIT App Inventor doesn’t make it easy to talk directly to the firebase.
                Instead we opted for a HTML file that will handle this communication.
                By using the App inventors WebViewer we can run a HTML file and have
                it communicated to the Firebase and to the App inventor allowing for
                authenticated logins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cloud storage was an interesting challenge to tackle as we wanted
                to create an easy way to store all assets for a user into one
                easy section to retrieve when needed. To achieve this result,
                we made all the assets into a list which is stored as one line
                within the firebase database that could be easily separated if
                needed. To expand this, we also created a function that allows
                us to separate each asset down into the individual parts such
                as name, description, cost, etc allowing for easier implementation
                when we add the edit asset screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                 <img src="assets/img/detail.png" style="width:70%;"/>                                                                                                
              </p>
              <p>                                                                                                 
                Adding the edit asset function was the most challenging part of
                the entire project. To implement this function, we needed to make
                sure all areas of the assets where properly split up and put into
                the correct locations. This was such a struggle due to the MIT App
                Inventor not waiting for the firebase values when called. This means
                if the firebase was slow sometimes the app would crash with no
                indication for what went wrong. This issue was a struggle to diagnose
                but once found we easily fixed it by adding a delay to the call which
                allows for the firebase values to catchup. With this we made sure to
                also add some more user-friendly functions like asking if you wanted
                to delete when deleting an asset and a loading indicator when waiting
                for values.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last function we added was the Image storing for the receipts
                and images of the item. We attempted to use the firebase storage
                to upload all the images and call them down when needed, but where
                unsuccessful due to the firebase storage extension being community
                made and with several connection bugs. Instead we opted to store all
                the images on the device to hold a proof of concept, this implementation
                would be one of the first things I would change if we had more time.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the app currently in version 10, many features have been successfully
                implemented, while other features still require the ironing out of
                small bugs and issues. Some small bugs are known, such as potential
                Firebase authentication issues when attempting to login to the app.
                With more time, tweaking and learning, these bugs will continue to be
                ironed out and our application will become increasingly stable.

              <h3>Roles</h3>
              <p>
                The roles we have taken within our group aren’t as clear cut as
                it might seem. Every one of our members have contributed towards
                each area of our project, this spread of work allows for all our
                team to communicate effectively and properly discuss the outcome
                we want to achieve. To split our group into roles we had to look
                at what each person contributed to the most:
              </p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">
                Aidian: Software Developer
              </p>
              <p>
                Aidian’s role requires someone with software programming understanding.
                The MIT app inventor is great for new learners to programming but
                completing complex tasks takes a lot of problem solving. Aidian had
                to ensure bugs where fixed, functionality was working, and cloud
                implementation was reached.
              </p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">
                Geoffrey: Designer and Software Developer
              </p>
              <p>
                 <img src="assets/img/roles.jpg" align="right" style="width:350px;height:250px;padding-left:30px;"/>                         
                Geoffrey’s role as designer would task him to create the user
                interface for the client to use in an effortless way. This would
                include designing the user interactions, ideas for features and
                looks of the app and much more. Being in a small team the designer
                will also need to have software programming skills to ensure his
                implementations work as intended.
              </p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">
                Mitchell: Web Designer/ Video Editor
              </p>
              <p>
                Mitchells role as Web Designer is essential for conveying our report.
                This role requires knowledge and skills in web design, programming
                and art to create a visually appealing site that will grab the users
                attention. Video Editor is essential for our presentation. This role
                brings together all the clips created and ties them into one neat
                presentation that best shows off our project.
              </p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">
                Bryce: Report Writer, Editor and Video Recorder
              </p>
              <p>
                Bryce’s role as Report Writer/Editor is essential to ensure all
                reports are professional, grammatically correct and well documented,
                this role needs great understanding of the English language and
                professional etiquette when report writing. Bryce was also a part
                of the video recordings for the presentation taking the role of
                the Designer.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Emre’s role is very similar to Bryce’s, Report writing, and documenting
                is an extremely important part of the production of our app. Emre
                was also a part of the video recordings for the presentation taking
                the role of the Software Engineer.

                Team Troubleshoot’s scope if this project is to deliver a working
                visual representation of what the app will look like and how it will
                function. With our limited time we will not be able to implement all
                the features we have planned, instead we will focus on the basic
                functionality of the app such as Loging in, Listing, adding and deleting
                assets, Basic cloud storage, uploading images, easy to follow user
                interface and the ability to exporting your data. We are also researching
                into getting the basic functionality of an OCR to enable to app to
                read in information from an image of a receipt, we wish to implement
                this feature in full but due to time limitations we may only be able
                to implement partial/basics of this feature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to time limits we are unable to implement all the features we
                wish to. Some features like collecting images from the web using
                input data, scanning a picture of the device to allow for the app
                to gather information for you and the ability to create your own
                fields within the list where cut out of the scope as the team have
                seen this impractical to implement due to our limited knowledge,
                time restrains.

              <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
              <p>
                The Troubleshooter app and project makes use of a range of different
                tools and technologies to create the final production, as well as the
                marketing video. When we conducted our initial review into building
                Troubleshooter we went around the team to understand what background
                we had in app development, whether that be web, iOS, Android or other.
                While there was some basic knowledge of iOS development from Mitchell
                and Android (Java) development from Aidian it was not our speciality.
                Web development was our strongest skill with all members being able to
                get involved in some way, but Troubleshooter was designed to be an
                app you can run from your phone because portability and the use of the
                camera are some of the foundations of the feature set. This led us
                to further explore options and we came upon a tool called MIT App Inventor.
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-8">
                  <p>
                    MIT App Inventor is a web app that provides an easy to use interface
                    to get up and running with a phone application very quickly
                    and without a deep understanding of all the iOS and Android
                    frameworks. MIT App Inventor has been used to create apps such
                    as COVID-19 data tracker, bipolar management and scheduling
                    app and apps to help manage share houses. As none of the team
                    had experience with this tool, we made some example “dummy
                    apps” and quickly realised it would meet the requirements
                    for our first version and prototype of the Troubleshooter
                    smart phone application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As MIT App Inventor would cover off everything we needed to
                    build the app (including camera and data storage support),
                    we could focus on what we needed to create the marketing video
                    for the Troubleshooter app. After another check of the team’s
                    background in storyboarding and video editing, we had enough
                    knowledge to get us across the line without too much additional
                    learning. We again reviewed the tools and technologies that are
                    available to us and had to cross of a handful of them due to
                    the price tag (e.g. Adobe Premiere). We decided that we would
                    use iMovie (free) for our video editing app and Microsoft PowerPoint
                    as our app for the storyboard. The whole team had experience with
                    PowerPoint and once we set out the storyboard template, we could
                    all get involved and Aidian and Mitchell both had a small background
                    in basic video editing (albeit with Adobe Premiere) and offered
                    to assist with any of the video editing.

                Outside of the direct technologies required for the Troubleshooter
                app itself the team always relies heavily on the Microsoft Office
                suite of products and use Microsoft Teams as our communication platform
                as well as Microsoft Word and Notes to consolidate our ideas and

              <h3>Testing</h3>
              <p>
                An important part of designing the application is the testing phase,
                a plan needs to be put in place to ensure everything is working
                throughout the application. There are many areas that need to be
                considered when testing the design of our new application “Troubleshooter”.
                The following areas are User Interface testing, Functional Testing,
                Database Testing, Load Testing, Performance, Security Testing, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                User Interface testing is required to ensure that the interface will meet user expectations.
                The following areas need to be tested throughout the process.
              </p>
              <img src="assets/img/test.jpg" align="right" style="width:300px;height:250px;padding-left:20px;"/>
              <ul>
                <li>Check Screen Validations</li>
                <li>Verify All Navigations</li>
                <li>Check usability Conditions</li>
                <li>Verify Data Integrity</li>
                <li>Verify the object states</li>
                <li>Verify the date Field and Numeric Field Formats</li>
                <li>Verify the compatibility of the User Interface on various platforms (IOS, Android)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Functional testing is also required to test each function of Troubleshooter’s software application, by
                providing appropriate input and verifying the output against the Functional requirements. The following
                areas need to be addressed in this testing phase.
              <ul>
                <li>Understand the Functional Requirements</li>
                <li>Identify test input or test data based on requirements</li>
                <li>Compute the expected outcomes with selected test input values</li>
                <li>Execute test cases</li>
                <li>Compare actual and computed expected results</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Database testing was also required. This involves performing data validity, data integrity testing,
                performance check related to database and testing of procedures, triggers, and functions in the database.
                From database testing point of view, the following checks should be performed −
              <ul>
                <li>The transactional information from the application should be stored in the database and it should
                  provide correct information to the user.</li>
                <li>Information should not be lost when it is loaded to database.</li>
                <li>Only completed transactions should be stored and all incomplete operations should be aborted by the
                  application.</li>
                </li>Access authorization to database should be maintained. No unapproved or unauthorized access to
                user information should be provided.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Load testing one among the various kinds of performance testing,
                this is required to determine the performance of the application in
                real time load conditions. It is used to ensure that the application
                performs satisfactorily when many users try to access or use it at
                the same time.
              <ul>
                <li>Running multiple applications on a computer or server simultaneously</li>
                <li>Subjecting a server to a large amount of traffic</li>
                <li>Writing and reading data to and from a hard disk continuously</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Performance Testing was used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability,
                and resource usage of a software application under a particular workload.
                The focus of Performance Testing was to ensure the application’s
              <ul>
                <li>Speed - Determines whether the application responds quickly</li>
                <li>Scalability - Determines maximum user load the software application can handle.</li>
                <li>Stability - Determines if the application is stable under varying loads</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Security testing is another important aspect of the application.
                There are four focus areas to be considered in security testing of the application.<br>
                Network security: This involves looking for vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure (resources and
                policies).<br>
                System software security: This involves assessing weaknesses in the various software (operating system,
                database system, and other software) the application depends on.<br>
                Client-side application security: This deals with ensuring that the client (browser or any such tool)
                cannot be manipulated.<br>
                Server-side application security: This involves making sure that the server code and its technologies are
                robust enough to fend off any intrusion.
              </p>
              <p>
                To summarise the testing phase, there are many areas that need to
                be covered to optimize the performance of the application. Ideally
                6 test users with skills in the specific areas above would be
                required to focus on each area of the testing phase, however less
                test users would be required depending on their skillset. All
                hardware devices need to be tested such as photo scanning technology
                devices, storage, computer, and hand-held devices to be compatible
                with the software used for the application across multiple platforms.

              <h3>Risks</h3>
              <p>
                Our team's "Troubleshoot" app faces several risks that will present
                themselves both during development and well into our hypothetical
                launch. Outside of the generic risks associated with any I.T. project,
                developing and Android app has its own unique set of risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specific to our own group, and the nature of this assignment,
                inexperience is a very real risk to our project: having never
                developed an Android app before, there is the risk that we may
                not be able to learn, understand and implement advanced techniques
                (such as OCR) in a reasonable timeframe. Inexperience is a unique
                risk to our project in that the only way to overcome it is to
                either spend increasing amounts of time to become experienced,
                or to add a member to the team that possesses the relevant experience,
                much like a company would.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="assets/img/risks.jpg" align="right" style="width:400px;height:300px;padding-left:30px;"/>
                Another risk is that of being tied to one platform. Being an
                Android app, how many potential users are we missing out on? The
                need to translate the app to accommodate the iOS platform down
                the line may exist, in order to deliver a comprehensive product.
              </p>
              <p>                      
                Tying into the previous risk, there is the possibility of the
                application being denied by the relevant app store. App store/marketplace
                rules are always subject to change, and there is no guarantee that
                even a successful implementation of the "Troubleshoot" app will be
                approved for sale.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also always the risk that the "Troubleshoot" app won't
                meet the end users' needs. The app may not have the desired features
                implemented in the way our intended users really need. Conversely,
                our app could potentially have too many features, leaving the end
                user with difficulty in getting what they need from out app. Our
                solution will need to be user-friendly and concise in what it has
                to offer, with a well-tailored UI that communicates a wealth of
                features in a simple manner.

              <p>
                To use our artefact, you will need to install it onto your device
                as the emulator supplied doesn’t have support for firebase authentication
                and the Ai2 Companion app doesn’t work with our login screen
                implemented with a HTML file.

              <p>
                To get the best experience you need to download the APK file either
                by using our download link or going to our project page,
                Instructions for both are below.

               To be able to build the Troubleshooter app, from our project
                page you will need to import it into MIT App Inventor. This
                can be done by selecting the Load app into MIT App Inventor
                link. Once you have the project in the App Inventor you can
                choose to build the app. This will allow you to either download
                the APK file or ‘scan a QR code’ to download it straight
                to your phone.

                The members in our team communicate by having meetings twice per
                week and sending messages through chat using MS Teams. Every meeting,
                the group discuss the tasks that need to be complete and set goals
                to have some of these completed by the next meeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also discuss the current progress of our assignment, ideas for
                our website and how to achieve the results required for our project
                idea. In the meeting agenda notes, we have a progress and things to
                do list. This list allows each of the team members to view our current
                progress, tasks that each team member are currently working on, and tasks
                that are still outstanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a team member is not present at the meeting, a message is sent
                through chat on MS Teams, to advise what was discussed at the
                meeting and tasks that are required to be complete. The team member
                absent is then required to select an incomplete task from the list.
                If a group member fails to respond, the rest of team work together
                to take on the additional tasks that have not been completed.

              Designing the application or website is one of the most important
              skills and tasks for this project. In today's world presentation
              is key. One of the most memorable moments for many consumers would
              be the first time they see the application. At how organized it is
              and how easy it is to access files or documents for any claim new
              or old. The foundation of this app was built on easy accessibility
              for the users. And that is the person we need. Someone with designing
              skills because once the user starts the app, he/she is greeted with
              what the designer created
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the fundamental skills that is needed is organization. The
              home page must be organized so the user can easily find what he/she
              is searching for, with minimal taps of course. The designer must
              have great teamwork skills as well. He/she should be open to any feedback,
              good or bad regarding the design of the app and its usability. And
              lastly innovative thinking is a must. Our application must be
              different and easier to use than our competitors' applications
              (if we have any). We simply cannot just write and say to the customer
              that our app is better than the other applications. We must show it.
              We must show how our app stands out and how our designer is only one
              of a kind. And that designer is only exclusive to the application of
              Troubleshooter.

              Assignment 3 has been a fantastic continuation of the concepts we
              developed throughout Assignment 2. Throughout this assignment we
              have carried forward a fantastic sense of teamwork and group organisation,
              working cohesively to produce what I believe to be a really solid
              result. We got cracking nice and early developing a strong plan for
              the entirety of the project and stuck to this plan very well. Our
              systematic approach to the project worked very well, with each portion
              broken down into clear steps with manageable deadlines. Aidian did
              an awesome job in finding our platform, the MIT App Inventor, which
              gave us a great foundation for developing the project without being
              too hindered by our lack of experience in app development. Mitchell’s
              broader range of knowledge helped immensely in pushing us through
              technical roadblocks, allowing more to be done in our time limit.
              Emre’s organisation and consistency in getting everything assigned
              to him done incredibly quickly is to be commended, and is something
              I have found quite inspiring. Geoff’s rapid learning of the App
              Inventor platform and keen interest in the technical component of
              this project has been instrumental in getting us to this point. Well
              done everyone.

              I am proud to be a member of Team Troubleshoot, each member of the team worked well together to
              accomplish all the tasks required for assignment 3. The team have looked at the feedback from
              assignment 2 and discussed as a group what improvements could be made. Unfortunately, there has
              been no correspondence from Samuel for this assignment, however the rest of the members of the
              group have worked well together to finish the rest of the tasks required.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team set a solid plan at the start of assignment 3, which allocated time in the last week to
              proof-read all documentation and to make any final adjustments required for our assignment.
              Communication between team members using MS-Teams throughout this assignment and having a
              checklist with our agenda notes to view the current stages of our progress worked very well.
              Each member of the team has done a great job with their contribution to the assignment and to
              the Git Hub repository. I am surprised how much our team has achieved in such a short time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my view, although I am happy with the team’s achievement with the assignment and the progress
              of our App, if there was more time allocated to complete the assignment, the only improvement
              would be the advancement in the development of the App.

              For Team Troubleshoot’s Assignment 3 we were able to take some of our learnings from
              Assignment 2 and apply them here to improve on our previous work. We came up with a
              solid long-term plan, compared to the more week to week plans of Assignment 2 and
              this helped us stay on track by the due date. We also took on board the feedback from
              the tutor for Assignment 2 and allotted our final week of the assignment to be
              dedicated to proof-reading and fixes. We also heard that the website was a bit stale
              as it was just a wall of text. We took this on board and have used more imagery in
              both the report and website and made the website more interactive and visual so it’s
              not just a duplicate of the report. It was surprising and a please to see the
              commitment from the group to improve on Assignment 2. Geoff even went out and
              purchased some HTML/CSS/JS books to improve his website building skills. Working as a
              team isn’t always easy, but as long as we continued to set clear and concise
              deadlines and be willing to lend a hand to others it allowed us to get the job done
              without too many roadblocks.

              Again, as I said before, during assignment 2. I would not want to be
              in another team other than team troubleshoot. I find myself extremely
              lucky to be in this group with my current team members. For this assignment,
              I felt that, because everyone knows everyone's way of working, we had a better
              workflow for this assignment than the previous one. We started to know what
              our core strengths were and what we had to improve upon. And what made
              us ready as a team was at how early we started. This gave us a huge
              head start. All in all, I am grateful to be a member for this team.
              I have received the best assistance from my team members, and I know
              that if I had something that was hard for me, all I had to do was ask
              and my team members would be there for me and help me with my tasks.
              The only downside that would come to my mind would be at how short
              the study period was for this assignment. I'm sure that if we had
              more time, we could have made an immense difference to this assignment. 
              I'm not saying that we did a bad job, I'm just saying that with more
              time comes more planning. And it is planning that makes us get through
              this tunnel.

              In my opinion Team Troubleshoot has continued to work extremely well
              as a team. We’ve had meetings twice a week to discuss ideas, problems,
              create plans and actions for the future as well as constant communication
              within our chats. We were not afraid to present problems or ideas,
              and all contributed towards our project. Sadly, Samuel did not contribute
              towards the project, we tried several communication attempts - assigning
              him tasks and inviting him to meetings, but he did not respond. Bryce
              however strived for greater marks and has become more active within our
              group, striving to get more tasks completed and stronger communication
              with us all which was fantastic to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              As reflected from our previous assignment we strived to be more prepared
              in our meetings and our project. We all worked together as a team to
              construct what we should have completed before the next meeting and
              all contributed in a meaningful way.  If there was anything I would
              improve upon, it would be the platform we created our app on. If we
              had a longer period, we would be able to learn and implement a more
              complex and powerful platform. Team Troubleshoot continues to work
              and took each other's feedback, communicated effectively and worked
              hard on the product. I have learned more about teamwork, meeting
              organisation, and the way people work within the IT industry. Our
              GitHub activity shows that we have all been contributing work towards
              the website; once we have finished a part of our work, Bryce as he
              has a more advance grasp on English volunteered to go over our work
              to spell and grammar check before we submit to our site. We make sure
              we have all checked over it then we upload it to our page with each
              person being responsible to upload their own sections. I am amazed
              at what we could create in such a small time and am glad to have the
              pleasure to work within this Team Troubleshoot.

              To summarise Team Troubleshoot’s group reflection based on all the information provided, the
              entire team has a positive response regarding the collaboration of assignment 3.

            <p>                        
              Our Team took a slightly different approach to this assignment, starting early and setting a solid
              long-term plan. Time was also allotted in the final week to proof-read all documentation and make
              any final adjustments required to our assignment. Feedback from assignment 2 has allowed us to
              focus on developing a much greater result.</p>
            <p>
              The team continued to use MS-Teams as our communication method, meetings were conducted twice per
              week to discuss our current progress, ideas, problems, and any further action that was required.
              The members in the team used their initiative to select areas of the assignment, working on tasks
              that were broken into manageable portions to have completed before the next meeting. Each meeting
              contained a checklist with agenda notes allowing the team members to continue and monitor the
              progress throughout the assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              All members of the group were pleased and surprised with the overall commitment and improvement
              working on assignment 3, this resulting to getting so much done in such a short timeframe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, there was no contribution from Samuel with this assignment, there were several
              communication attempts, tasks assigned and meeting invitations throughout the duration of the
              assignment, however no response was received.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every member of the team has done a fantastic job with their contributions towards the assignment
              and Git Hub repository. Everyone was able to share and implement some of their own ideas
              throughout the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most common experiences learned from working with groups relate to the importance of planning
              and how much we can all learn from each other as a team. This concept has continued throughout
              assignment 3 as the team skillsets and experience continue to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website has also been modified with the design as changes were required to improve
              presentation. The design consists of more imagery and has been constructed to be more interactive
              and visual.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team were very happy about the current development of the Troubleshooter App, having created
              some of its functionality in such a short timeframe. From majority of the individual reflections
              within the group, the only improvement would be advancing the development of the App, this could
              be achieved if there was more time allocated to complete the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion to the group reflection, being a part of Team Troubleshoot was a great learning
              experience, all members should be proud of all the hard work and effort that was put into this
              assignment.
