                it was a memorable name and the term troubleshoot is one that is relatable to IT.

              My name’s Bryce Allen, and I am currently undertaking RMIT’s Bachelor
              of I.T. I am a proud member of Team Troubleshoot for the purpose of
              this assignment. I have moved back and forth between Ballarat and
              Melbourne the last few years and have finally settled down back in
              Ballarat where I was born. I currently work for a small company
              building high-end custom PCs for both personal and commercial use.
              My role is assembling, testing, and troubleshooting our products.
              I have always had a passion for the hardware side of computing and
              hoping to expand my knowledge into the software side of things.
              When I am not working or tinkering, I play in a few bands locally
              and have a passion for audio engineering and sound production; I
              am most often found in my sketchy home studio amongst a tangle of
              cables and gear.

                My name is Geoffrey Boyle and I am currently studying the Bachelor
                of Information Technology at RMIT University, I am a member of Team
                Troubleshoot for our assessment tasks. I am currently 43 years of age
                and was born in Brisbane, Australia. My current employer is Australia
                Post, for the past 13 years as a Postal Delivery Officer. My interests
                and hobbies consist of travelling, playing rugby league, watching
                movies, fishing, and working with computers. My interest in IT started
                back at high school, there are many different areas that I enjoy.
                For that reason, the current field that I would like to pursue is
                still currently undecided. Ideally to become multi-skilled with
                Networking, Web Development, and some Programming would be my dream.
                With the variety of subjects on offer from RMIT University, it will
                expand my knowledge and through study, I will find the career
                pathway that I will pursue in the future. My current experience in
                IT relates to building computers, upgrading, diagnosing problems
                and repairs. After completing high school in 1995, I had continued
                further study in Web Development, however I need to retrain my skills
                in this field.

                My name is Mitchell and I am a member of Team Troubleshoot. I am
                studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University
                and have a strong passion for technology and software development.
                I grew up in Queensland, Australia and began my degree there while
                I was working as a Business Analyst at a technology company in
                Brisbane City. Since then I have moved to Scotland, UK and studying
                remotely from there while also working as a software engineer. I
                have been working as a software developer for 1-2 years now and
                am focused on frontend development using Vue.js, but also work on
                some backend systems in PHP. Currently some of my favourite tech
                I am playing with is Vue.js (with a close eye on the upcoming v3
                release), DevOps CI/CD, serverless development and containerization
                (Docker and Kubernetes). If I am not playing around with tech I
                play (well played thanks to the pandemic) a lot of social sport,
                including AFL, touch football and indoor soccer.

                My name is Emre Sezgin. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria and now
                I reside in Brisbane, Queensland. I am a member of team troubleshoot.
                I am undertaking a bachelor of IT and my most up to date education
                is high school. Even though I grew up in Melbourne my nationality is
                Turkish/Australian, which means I also know Turkish as well and a
                little bit of Arabic. I work in aviation as ground operations officer
                at Brisbane airport (BNE). An interesting fact about me is that
                even though I love Holdens very much and own one myself, I was awfully
                close to buying a Ford and ruining my loyalty to Holden, sadly I am
                also devastated that the great lion will not be with us any longer.

                Some hobbies of mine are tennis, video games but mostly working on my car. Fixing
                it myself and learning new stuff while at it. The most recent modification I have
                done to it was installing a remote start module which allows it to start with the
                key, while pressing the lock button 3 times without the key even being inside the car.

                My name is Aidian and I am a member of Team Troubleshoot. I was
                born in Brisbane Queensland and moved down to Burnie Tasmania at
                an early age, after year 12 I moved down to Launceston to further
                my career and study but ended up getting a trainee IT position at
                the Department of Education. I am hoping to acquire a permanent
                position before my Trainee role ends. I Completed Year 12 and 2
                Units at Utas University for my Batchelor’s of Information Communications
                and Technology’s. I am currently studying through Open University
                with RMIT to complete the rest of my Batchelor’s. I have always had
                interest in IT technology’s which got me wanting to be a part of
                the IT industry. My main area of interest is networking as the idea
                of making systems communicate over large distances fascinates me.
                I have had 5 months experience within an IT role and may years of
                little troubleshooting jobs throughout the family. My hobbies
                include Gaming, VR, building computers and watching online videos.

              <p>
              Team Troubleshoot worked well together as a group by setting our
              targets and achieving our goals before every meeting. The meetings
              were conducted twice per week at a time that was suitable and agreed
              upon for all members to attend. There were a few minor things that
              we could have improved within the group, some of these improvements
              relate to planning and organization. We will be taking what we have
              learnt from assignment 2 and improving our processes for assignment
              3. We have already started our improvements by starting early,
              setting a plan from the beginning, and ensuring we are spreading
              the work.

                Specialized skills are the main factor that differentiates each
                of our roles, daily tasks, and responsibilities. Specialized areas
                are different for each position you strive for. This can be seen in
                our group as all 6 of us have unique pathways we can take to achieve
                our goals. Mitchell to become a software engineer will have to study
                and specialize in programming. Where Aidian who wants to become a
                Network engineer will need to study and specialize in Networking
                achieving standards and certificates to ensure he is qualified.

                Similarity
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of our positions all have the similarity of the team environment,
                we will all be working within a team to meet some goal. We will
                all need excellent communication skills to be able to do our role
                effectively and we will all need to constantly update ourselves
                with knowledge of new technology's, updates, and changes to ensure
                we can work efficiently.
                Although we will have this similarity our day-to-day work will
                be different Mitchells position as a Software Engineer means he
                will be spending most of his days programming, testing, and planning
                the creation/ updating and maintaining of software. This position
                allows for him to have the opportunity to work from offsite
                location as he is not tied to completing onsite tasks. When
                Mitchells position is compared to Emre’s we can see where these
                differences come from. Emre’s position is an IT Technical Officer,
                this position entails giving support to his clients, maintaining
                and upgrading current systems and providing technical support if
                something goes wrong. This position is mainly onsite whether it is
                in the office preparing for calls or to their location to assess
                any issues. These differences can be shown for all our positions
                as our specialized areas all have different requirements, needs
                and skills.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Team Troubleshoot’s project idea is an inventory app we are calling
                Troubleshooter. Troubleshooter allows home users to take and store
                inventory of their home assets. The Troubleshooter app will assist
                in tasks such as insurance claims, warranty claim and tax claims.
                Troubleshooter will allow for the home user to store information
                needed about their assets like cost, Description of item, model,
                Serial Numbers, Date of purchase, Scan or upload photos or receipts.
                Troubleshooter will also be able to assist in the recording process
                with features like image scanning technologies to gather information
                from the receipts, Online databases that can search for additional
                information about your product, example images from the internet of
                your product, and all your data can be easily exportable into
                different formats straight from the app. All your data will be
                stored in a secure cloud-based server behind a secure two factor
                authentication.
              </p>
              <p>
                Troubleshooter is designed all around the user experience. As
                Troubleshooter is aimed at the home audience our app will have a
                sleek and uncomplicated design to it. You will easily be able to
                login, create an asset, edit assets, or remove assets when needed.
                With a simple searchable list with images of your item displayed
                it will make finding what you need easy. The asset creation will
                be easy on the user with features like scanning from the receipt
                and searching for addition information and images from the internet
                you will not even need to type in any information. Our goal is to
                have an easy to use, effortless app that any home user can use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The motivation for this project is around Internet of thing, Smart
                automation to make people's lives easier. The task of asset management
                is not something people want to be doing, this mindset leads people
                into situations where they need to submit a tax claim or insurance
                claim but do not have any of the information needed. This projects
                aim is to create an app that is easy to use, automates as much of
                the process as possible and keeps all the data safe. To incorporate
                these features, we will need to grasp knowledge in Optical character
                recognition (OCR), Image recognition, cloud databases and two factor
                authentications. These subjects are complex and require a lot of
                self-learning and training to pull off showing dedication and passion
                towards the outcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are currently plenty of asset management software's out there
                including nest egg, MyStuff and Sortly, apps like these are our
                main competitors, these apps are packed full of features advanced
                options and functions that the average user would be confused about
                making starting out more confusing than it needs to be. The Troubleshooter
                app will combat this with an easy to use, uncomplicated design based for
                the home user, we will implement functions such as scanning from a receipt,
                gathering information and images from the web all to make the user
                experience more enjoyable.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div style="display: none;" id="project-plan_aims">
              <h3>Aims</h3>
              <p>
                Team Troubleshoot’s aim is to create a User-friendly app to record
                and keep track of assets. This app will be aimed at the home user to
                keep track of assets for insurance and tax claim purposes. Our app
                needs to have a clean modern design, functionality that is easy to
                follow for all users, Safe and secure data storage, Photo Scanning
                technology and a promotional video to show off all the features.
              </p>
              <p>
                The justification for this application is that there is only a small
                range of home inventory applications that give the freedom to store
                what you want and need. Our app will allow the user to add their own
                fields, Scan in photos, receipts, products from the internet. Our app
                will make sure the most information is recorded and available for
                the user as soon as they need it. All this information will improve
                tax returns and keep insurance claims delay free.
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve this larger goal, we will need to complete smaller tasks
                within the application, first goal would be to complete research of
                android app development and the possibility of using MIT Inventor
                to create the prototype. Research is essential when starting something
                new so looking at the skills we have and the tools we can use will
                be vital to starting this project. As we all have different coding
                knowledge, we think that using MIT Inventor to create the prototype
                would be a beneficial call as block-based coding is easier and faster
                to research and learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important goal is to create the back end or functionality
                of the application. This backend will handle all the user interactions,
                Passing Data, displaying the visuals correctly and allowing for the
                user to access and interact with the application. By completing the
                functionality of the application early on it allows for further
                testing, risk assessment and designing to take place all impacting
                the quality, efficiency, and usability of the application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data storage and security is a great concern for our team, one of
                our essential goals are to ensure all data is stored appropriately
                and secure. Storing data securely is extremely important to protect
                our data we record for the user. This data has sensitive financial
                information which should not be seen by unauthorized personnel, with
                storing this data in the cloud it brings both opportunity for
                security as well as risk that we will need to discover.
              </p>
              <p>
                Team Troubleshoots app needs to have a clean, modern, and function
                design not only functionally but visually. We need to create high
                quality visual elements and style for our app. This design will
                ensure the app is professional, easy to understand, visually appealing
                and easy to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scanning feature is a unique feature that will separate our
                app from the competitors, this feature will allow you to scan in
                receipts to import information and allow the user to take a picture
                of the product and the app will find as much more relevant information
                using the name, image recognition and any other information given.
                This allows you to add more information about your asset without
                having to do research or investigating. This feature gives the
                user more of a premium experience making the asset recording process
                easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creating a promotional video will help to bring awareness of the
                project. This promotional video is aimed to get home users to
                download the app and try the service we are providing. This
                promotional video needs to be professional, short sharp and
                straight to the point to keep the audience's attention. We will
                include subjects like the description of the app, security, and
                statistics.

                Team Troubleshoot’s scope if this project is to deliver a working
                visual representation of what the app will look like and how it will
                function. With our limited time we will not be able to implement all
                the features we have planned, instead we will focus on the basic
                functionality of the app such as Loging in, Listing, adding and deleting
                assets, Basic cloud storage, uploading images, easy to follow user
                interface and the ability to exporting your data. We are also researching
                into getting the basic functionality of an OCR to enable to app to
                read in information from an image of a receipt, we wish to implement
                this feature in full but due to time limitations we may only be able
                to implement partial/basics of this feature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to time limits we are unable to implement all the features we
                wish to. Some features like collecting images from the web using
                input data, scanning a picture of the device to allow for the app
                to gather information for you and the ability to create your own
                fields within the list where cut out of the scope as the team have
                seen this impractical to implement due to our limited knowledge,
                time restrains.

              <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
              <p>
                The Troubleshooter app and project makes use of a range of different
                tools and technologies to create the final production, as well as the
                marketing video. When we conducted our initial review into building
                Troubleshooter we went around the team to understand what background
                we had in app development, whether that be web, iOS, Android or other.
                While there was some basic knowledge of iOS development from Mitchell
                and Android (Java) development from Aidian it was not our speciality.
                Web development was our strongest skill with all members being able to
                get involved in some way, but Troubleshooter was designed to be an
                app you can run from your phone because portability and the use of the
                camera are some of the foundations of the feature set. This led us
                to further explore options and we came upon a tool called MIT App Inventor.
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-8">
                  <p>
                    MIT App Inventor is a web app that provides an easy to use interface
                    to get up and running with a phone application very quickly
                    and without a deep understanding of all the iOS and Android
                    frameworks. MIT App Inventor has been used to create apps such
                    as COVID-19 data tracker, bipolar management and scheduling
                    app and apps to help manage share houses. As none of the team
                    had experience with this tool, we made some example “dummy
                    apps” and quickly realised it would meet the requirements
                    for our first version and prototype of the Troubleshooter
                    smart phone application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As MIT App Inventor would cover off everything we needed to
                    build the app (including camera and data storage support),
                    we could focus on what we needed to create the marketing video
                    for the Troubleshooter app. After another check of the team’s
                    background in storyboarding and video editing, we had enough
                    knowledge to get us across the line without too much additional
                    learning. We again reviewed the tools and technologies that are
                    available to us and had to cross of a handful of them due to
                    the price tag (e.g. Adobe Premiere). We decided that we would
                    use iMovie (free) for our video editing app and Microsoft PowerPoint
                    as our app for the storyboard. The whole team had experience with
                    PowerPoint and once we set out the storyboard template, we could
                    all get involved and Aidian and Mitchell both had a small background
                    in basic video editing (albeit with Adobe Premiere) and offered
                    to assist with any of the video editing.

                Outside of the direct technologies required for the Troubleshooter
                app itself the team always relies heavily on the Microsoft Office
                suite of products and use Microsoft Teams as our communication platform
                as well as Microsoft Word and Notes to consolidate our ideas and
                report writing.

              <p>
                An important part of designing the application is the testing phase,
                a plan needs to be put in place to ensure everything is working
                throughout the application. There are many areas that need to be
                considered when testing the design of our new application “Troubleshooter”.
                The following areas are User Interface testing, Functional Testing,
                Database Testing, Load Testing, Performance, Security Testing, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                User Interface testing is required to ensure that the interface will meet user expectations.
                The following areas need to be tested throughout the process.
              </p>
              <img src="assets/img/test.jpg" align="right" style="width:300px;height:250px;padding-left:20px;"/>
              <ul>
                <li>Check Screen Validations</li>
                <li>Verify All Navigations</li>
                <li>Check usability Conditions</li>
                <li>Verify Data Integrity</li>
                <li>Verify the object states</li>
                <li>Verify the date Field and Numeric Field Formats</li>
                <li>Verify the compatibility of the User Interface on various platforms (IOS, Android)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Functional testing is also required to test each function of Troubleshooter’s software application, by
                providing appropriate input and verifying the output against the Functional requirements. The following
                areas need to be addressed in this testing phase.
              <ul>
                <li>Understand the Functional Requirements</li>
                <li>Identify test input or test data based on requirements</li>
                <li>Compute the expected outcomes with selected test input values</li>
                <li>Execute test cases</li>
                <li>Compare actual and computed expected results</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Database testing was also required. This involves performing data validity, data integrity testing,
                performance check related to database and testing of procedures, triggers, and functions in the database.
                From database testing point of view, the following checks should be performed −
              <ul>
                <li>The transactional information from the application should be stored in the database and it should
                  provide correct information to the user.</li>
                <li>Information should not be lost when it is loaded to database.</li>
                <li>Only completed transactions should be stored and all incomplete operations should be aborted by the
                  application.</li>
                </li>Access authorization to database should be maintained. No unapproved or unauthorized access to
                user information should be provided.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Load testing one among the various kinds of performance testing,
                this is required to determine the performance of the application in
                real time load conditions. It is used to ensure that the application
                performs satisfactorily when many users try to access or use it at
                the same time.
              <ul>
                <li>Running multiple applications on a computer or server simultaneously</li>
                <li>Subjecting a server to a large amount of traffic</li>
                <li>Writing and reading data to and from a hard disk continuously</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Performance Testing was used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability,
                and resource usage of a software application under a particular workload.
                The focus of Performance Testing was to ensure the application’s
              <ul>
                <li>Speed - Determines whether the application responds quickly</li>
                <li>Scalability - Determines maximum user load the software application can handle.</li>
                <li>Stability - Determines if the application is stable under varying loads</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Security testing is another important aspect of the application.
                There are four focus areas to be considered in security testing of the application.<br>
                Network security: This involves looking for vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure (resources and
                policies).<br>
                System software security: This involves assessing weaknesses in the various software (operating system,
                database system, and other software) the application depends on.<br>
                Client-side application security: This deals with ensuring that the client (browser or any such tool)
                cannot be manipulated.<br>
                Server-side application security: This involves making sure that the server code and its technologies are
                robust enough to fend off any intrusion.
              </p>
              <p>
                To summarise the testing phase, there are many areas that need to
                be covered to optimize the performance of the application. Ideally
                6 test users with skills in the specific areas above would be
                required to focus on each area of the testing phase, however less
                test users would be required depending on their skillset. All
                hardware devices need to be tested such as photo scanning technology
                devices, storage, computer, and hand-held devices to be compatible
                with the software used for the application across multiple platforms.

              <h3>Risks</h3>
              <p>
                Our team's "Troubleshoot" app faces several risks that will present
                themselves both during development and well into our hypothetical
                launch. Outside of the generic risks associated with any I.T. project,
                developing and Android app has its own unique set of risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specific to our own group, and the nature of this assignment,
                inexperience is a very real risk to our project: having never
                developed an Android app before, there is the risk that we may
                not be able to learn, understand and implement advanced techniques
                (such as OCR) in a reasonable timeframe. Inexperience is a unique
                risk to our project in that the only way to overcome it is to
                either spend increasing amounts of time to become experienced,
                or to add a member to the team that possesses the relevant experience,
                much like a company would.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another risk is that of being tied to one platform. Being an
                Android app, how many potential users are we missing out on? The
                need to translate the app to accommodate the iOS platform down
                the line may exist, in order to deliver a comprehensive product.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tying into the previous risk, there is the possibility of the
                application being denied by the relevant app store. App store/marketplace
                rules are always subject to change, and there is no guarantee that
                even a successful implementation of the "Troubleshoot" app will be
                approved for sale.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also always the risk that the "Troubleshoot" app won't
                meet the end users' needs. The app may not have the desired features
                implemented in the way our intended users really need. Conversely,
                our app could potentially have too many features, leaving the end
                user with difficulty in getting what they need from out app. Our
                solution will need to be user-friendly and concise in what it has
                to offer, with a well-tailored UI that communicates a wealth of
                features in a simple manner.

            <div style="display: none;" id="project-plan_processes">
              <h3>Group Processes and Communication</h3>
              <p>
                <img src="assets/img/group.jpg" align="right" style="width:400px;height:300px;padding-left:20px;"/>
                The members in our team communicate by having meetings twice per
                week and sending messages through chat using MS Teams. Every meeting,
                the group discuss the tasks that need to be complete and set goals
                to have some of these completed by the next meeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also discuss the current progress of our assignment, ideas for
                our website and how to achieve the results required for our project
                idea. In the meeting agenda notes, we have a progress and things to
                do list. This list allows each of the team members to view our current
                progress, tasks that each team member are currently working on, and tasks
                that are still outstanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a team member is not present at the meeting, a message is sent
                through chat on MS Teams, to advise what was discussed at the
                meeting and tasks that are required to be complete. The team member
                absent is then required to select an incomplete task from the list.
                If a group member fails to respond, the rest of team work together
                to take on the additional tasks that have not been completed.

              In my opinion Team Troubleshoot has continued to work extremely well
              as a team. We’ve had meetings twice a week to discuss ideas, problems,
              create plans and actions for the future as well as constant communication
              within our chats. We were not afraid to present problems or ideas,
              and all contributed towards our project. Sadly, Samuel did not contribute
              towards the project, we tried several communication attempts - assigning
              him tasks and inviting him to meetings, but he did not respond. Bryce
              however strived for greater marks and has become more active within our
              group, striving to get more tasks completed and stronger communication
              with us all which was fantastic to see.

              As reflected from our previous assignment we strived to be more prepared
              in our meetings and our project. We all worked together as a team to
              construct what we should have completed before the next meeting and
              all contributed in a meaningful way.  If there was anything I would
              improve upon, it would be the platform we created our app on. If we
              had a longer period, we would be able to learn and implement a more
              complex and powerful platform. Team Troubleshoot continues to work
              and took each other's feedback, communicated effectively and worked
              hard on the product. I have learned more about teamwork, meeting
              organisation, and the way people work within the IT industry. Our
              GitHub activity shows that we have all been contributing work towards
              the website; once we have finished a part of our work, Bryce as he
              has a more advance grasp on English volunteered to go over our work
              to spell and grammar check before we submit to our site. We make sure
              we have all checked over it then we upload it to our page with each
              person being responsible to upload their own sections. I am amazed
              at what we could create in such a small time and am glad to have the
              pleasure to work within this Team Troubleshoot.
