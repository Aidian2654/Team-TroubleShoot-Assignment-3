      <h3>Team Name</h3>
      <p>
        As a group we decided on the name “Team Troubleshoot”. We thought it was a memorable name
        and the term troubleshoot is one that is relatable to IT.

        I’m Bryce – 25 years old and have just begun studying IT in order to expand my skillset.
        I’ve moved back and forth between Ballarat and Melbourne the last few years, and have finally settled down back in Ballarat where I was born.
        I currently work for a small company building high-end custom PCs for both personal and commercial use.
        My role is essentially assembling, testing and troubleshooting our products. I’ve always had a passion for the hardware side of computing,
        and hoping to expand my knowledge into the software side of things.
        When I’m not working or tinkering, I play in a few bands locally and have a passion for audio engineering and sound production;
        I’m most often found in my sketchy home studio amongst a tangle of cables and gear.

        My name is Geoffrey Boyle and I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at
        RMIT University. I am a member of Team Troubleshoot for our assessment tasks. I am currently 43
        years of age and was born in Brisbane, Australia. My current employer is Australia Post, for the
        past 13 years as a Postal Delivery Officer. My interests and hobbies consist of travelling,
        playing rugby league, watching movies, fishing, and working with computers.
        My interest in IT started back at high school, there are many different areas that I enjoy.
        For that reason, the current field that I would like to pursue is still currently undecided.
        Ideally to become multi-skilled with Networking, Web Development, and some Programming would be
        my dream. With the variety of subjects on offer from RMIT University, it will expand my knowledge
        and through study, I will find the career pathway that I will pursue in the future. My current
        experience in IT relates to building computers, upgrading, diagnosing problems and repairs.
        After completing high school in 1995, I had continued further study in Web Development, however
        I need to retrain my skills in this field.

        My name is Mitchell and I am a member of Team Troubleshoot. I am studying a Bachelor of
        Information Technology at RMIT University and have a strong passion for technology and
        software development. I grew up in Queensland, Australia and began my degree there while I
        was working as a Business Analyst at a technology company in Brisbane City. Since then I have
        moved to Scotland, UK and studying remotely from there while also working as a software
        engineer. I have been working as a software developer for 1-2 years now and predominately am
        focused on frontend development using Vue.js, but also work on some backend systems in PHP.
        Currently some of my favourite tech I am playing with is Vue.js (with a close eye on the
        upcoming v3 release), DevOps CI/CD, serverless development and containerization (Docker and
        Kubernetes). If I am not playing around with tech I play (well played thanks to the pandemic)
        a lot of social sport, including AFL, touch football and indoor soccer.

        My name is Sam Fairbrother and I am apart of Team Troubleshoot. I am currently living in Canberra
        where I work as a chef in an Italian restaurant. I moved from my hometown of Newcastle in 2018 as
        I was enrolled to study computer science at the ANU. I later had to withdraw from this course as
        I had some health problems that required me to return home for a while. However, I have stayed in
        Canberra as my fiancé has work obligations here. I am studying the Bachelor of IT through OUA as
        I still have a great passion for IT and aim to start a career in the IT field. My main areas of
        interest are business information systems and cyber security. My interests and hobbies include
        cooking, rugby, gaming, and spending time by the beach. My interest in IT started when I began
        playing video games when I was younger, this introduced me to the world of IT and eventually my
        intrigue led me to learning more about different aspects of IT. Regarding my experience in IT, I
        have always been the nominated IT-problem-solver of the household, whether it be fixing a computer,
        the internet, printers etc, so I have had a lot of exposure to little things like this that then
        require me to further research to solve the problem. One of the things that I love about IT is the
        ability to solve a problem just through self-research online, and the great feeling that you get when
        you are able to fix something.

        My name is Emre Sezgin and i am a member of team troubleshoot. I was born in Melbourne,
        Victoria and now i reside in Brisbane, Queensland. I am undertaking a bachelor of IT
        and my most up to date education is high school. Even thought I grew up in Melbourne my
        nationality is Turkish/Australian, which means I also know Turkish as well and a little
        bit of Arabic. I work in Aviation as a ground operations officer at Brisbane Airport (BNE).
        An interesting fact about me is that even though I love Holdens very much and own one myself,
        I was very close †o buying a Ford and ruining my loyalty to Holden, sadly I am also
        devastated that the great lion will not be with us any longer.

        Some hobbies of mine are Tennis, video games, TV shows but mostly working on my car.
        Fixing it myself and learning new stuff while at it. The most recent modification I
        have done to it was installing a remote start module which allows it to remotly start with the
        key, while pressing the lock button 3 times without the key even being inside the car.

        always had interest in IT technology’s which got me wanting to be a
        part of the IT industry. My main area of interest is networking as
        the idea of making systems communicate over large distances fascinates
        me. I have had 5 months experience within an IT role and may years of
        little troubleshooting jobs throughout the family. My hobbies include
        Gaming, VR, building computers and watching online videos.
